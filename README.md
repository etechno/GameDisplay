# GameDisplay

Game Display is an Android application written in Kotlin. Its purpose is to display free to play games in a list. Games can be selected by tapping them from this list, showing more details.

The list of games is obtained from freetogame.com via their api. A recyclerView is used to show the list. There is also a sliding animation between the detail and list views.
